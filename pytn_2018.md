### More testing with fewer tests

## Tests, amirite?
* Unit
* Integration
* Regression
* Acceptance

Do we really need to add to this?

Note: We already have a comprehensive suite of tests, why do we need another one?
---
# Unit Tests

Usually look like:

```python
    def test():
       res = function(value)
       assert res = this_specific_thing
```
Note: typically we test a specific return value that we already know to be right.
This is problematic for several reasons. 
---
## Unit Tests Redux

Worse, they probably look like this:

```python
    def test_1():
       res = function(value)
       assert res = this_specific_thing

    def test_2():
       res = function(other_value)
       assert res = this_one_edge_case

    def test_3():
       res = function(one_more_value)
       assert res = this_other_edge_case
```
Note: We often end up writing multiplpe tests for the same unit. 
And what if we miss an edge case? 
Why all the duplicate code?
So, how do we fix this?

### Property Tests!

* Look like a unit test
* Great at catching edge cases
* Reduces duplicate code
* Make you think. A lot. 

Note: 

---
### Basic Property Test Form
```python

from hypothesis import given, settings
from hypothesis import strategies as st


@given(st.integers(min_value=0, max_value=10))
def test(test_input):
   res = finction(test_input)
   assert some_invariant == res
```
---

# Strategies
* ints, strings, floats, booleans
* lists, tuples, dicts
